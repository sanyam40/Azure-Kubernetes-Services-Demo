# Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

## Components:
- **Service Accounts/Users**: Entities that Kubernetes uses to authenticate processes running in a Pod to access the API server. They are assigned to Pods and used by them to authenticate to the API server.
  
- **Roles/ClusterRoles**: Define a set of permissions (verbs) for accessing resources within a namespace (Role) or across the entire cluster (ClusterRole). These permissions include actions such as create, get, list, watch, delete, etc. They are defined in YAML files.

- **RoleBindings/ClusterRoleBindings**: Bind roles or cluster roles to specific users, groups, or service accounts. This association grants the defined permissions to the subjects.

## Role and Role Binding:
- **Role**: A YAML file containing rules specifying what actions are allowed (or denied) on which resources within a namespace. For example, a Role may grant read access to Pods and ConfigMaps within a namespace.
  
- **RoleBinding**: Binds a Role to one or more users, groups, or service accounts. It specifies who can perform the actions defined in the Role. For instance, a RoleBinding may associate a Role with a ServiceAccount, granting permissions to pods associated with that ServiceAccount.

## Additional Points:

- **Namespace Scope**: Roles and RoleBindings are typically scoped to a single namespace, allowing for fine-grained access control within that namespace. ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings, on the other hand, apply cluster-wide.

- **Aggregated Roles**: In addition to custom Roles, Kubernetes also provides pre-defined aggregated roles like `edit`, `admin`, etc., which can be used for common access control scenarios.

- **RBAC Policies**: RBAC policies can be complex, involving multiple Roles and RoleBindings to achieve the desired level of access control. Proper planning and testing are crucial to ensure the security of the cluster.

- **Default Roles**: Kubernetes provides some default Roles and ClusterRoles (e.g., `admin`, `view`, `edit`) that can be used out-of-the-box. However, custom Roles may often be necessary to tailor permissions to specific use cases.

- **RBAC Best Practices**: It's essential to follow RBAC best practices, such as the principle of least privilege, regularly reviewing and auditing access policies, and segregating duties to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

- **RBAC Evolution**: RBAC policies may evolve over time as the cluster's requirements change or new security threats emerge. Regularly revisiting and updating RBAC configurations is essential for maintaining a secure Kubernetes environment.

- **RBAC in Managed Kubernetes Services**: Managed Kubernetes services (e.g., Amazon EKS, Google GKE, Azure AKS) often provide additional RBAC features and integrations with the underlying cloud IAM (Identity and Access Management) services for more robust access control.
