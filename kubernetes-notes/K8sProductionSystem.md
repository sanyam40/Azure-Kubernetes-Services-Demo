## Kubernetes Production Systems

Kubernetes itself is an open-source platform, but several distributions of Kubernetes are available in the market, offering various features and support options.

### Kubernetes Distributions
- **EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service)**
- **OpenShift**
- **Tanzu**
- **Rancher**

In production environments, using vanilla Kubernetes might lead to delays in support and updates. Hence, organizations often opt for Kubernetes distributions.

### Popular Kubernetes Distributions (in order of popularity)
1. **OpenShift**: Offers enterprise-grade features and support.
2. **Rancher**: Provides a comprehensive platform for managing Kubernetes clusters.
3. **Tanzu**: VMware's Kubernetes offering, emphasizing simplicity and scalability.
4. **EKS**: Amazon's managed Kubernetes service, suitable for cloud-native applications.

### Other Tools and Platforms
- **Minikube**: Used for local development and testing, not for production. It's a single-node cluster running on a local machine.
- **Kops**: Kubernetes Operations, a tool for creating, destroying, upgrading, and maintaining production-grade Kubernetes clusters.

Kops simplifies the management of Kubernetes clusters by automating various operational tasks.
